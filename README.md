# eGKsc

based on https://github.com/spilikin/go-card/blob/master/examples/show-atr/main.go

I just needed a good example to extract information fron a gematik production test eGK. 

Not being suphisticated enough in golang and pkg usage could not get it compiled by importing from git, so I copied the example and all required package code locally and brought everything into the main pkg

made Dockerfile to compile and build.sh to copy the build binary back to the host
